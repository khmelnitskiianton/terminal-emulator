.SH DESCRIPTION
iksTerm (XTerminal) is a simple terminal emulator for X11. The project is hosted on GitHub at
.BR "https://github.com/khmelnitskiianton/terminal-emulator"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Show help and exit.
.TP
.B \-wNUM, --width=NUM
Set the width of the terminal window in cells. Default is 80.
.TP
.B \-lNUM, --length=NUM
Set the length of the terminal window in cells. Default is 40.
.TP
.B \-fHEX_NUM, --foreground=HEX_NUM
Set the foreground (text) color in hexadecimal format (e.g. "#ffffff"). Default is "#ffffff".
.TP
.B \-bHEX_NUM, --background=HEX_NUM
Set the background color in hexadecimal format (e.g. "#000000"). Default is "#000000".
.TP
.B \-cHEX_NUM, --cursor=HEX_NUM
Set the cursor color in hexadecimal format (e.g. "#777777"). Default is "#777777".
.TP
.B \-sPATH, --shell=PATH
Set the shell to be launched in the terminal. Default is "/bin/sh".
.TP
.B \-oNAME, --font=NAME
Set the font to be used by X11 (use `xlsfonts` to list available fonts). Default is "fixed".
.SH FEATURES
This GUI terminal provides user simple interface to communicate with shell.
The basic version of iksTerm provides the following features and opportunities:
.IP "Resizing and moving:"
    The terminal window can be dynamically resized while preserving the current screen content,
    allowing for flexible display configurations.
.IP "Input and Output Handling:"
    Standard input editing is supported in canonical mode. This includes proper handling of 
    backspace, as well as control sequences for the clear command (specifically, ESC [ H, ESC [ 2 J,
    and ESC [ 3 J) that allow clearing the screen.
.IP "Shell Integration:"
    A pseudoterminal (PTY) is established between the terminal emulator and the shell (default /bin/sh),
    enabling full interactive command execution with real-time output.
.IP "Customizable Appearance:"
    The appearance of the terminal is fully configurable through command-line options. You can set
    the terminal's width and length (in cells), choose a font from X11 (e.g. "fixed" or "helvetica"), and
    define custom color schemes for the foreground, background, and cursor.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "$ iksTerm --width=100 -s/bin/bash -c\"#aaa000\""
Set custom width, shell, and cursor color.
.IP "$ iksTerm -l56 --foreground=\"#FF00FF\" -o\"helvetica\""
Set length, foreground color, and font.
.SH STRUCTURE OF TERMINAL EMULATION
The terminal emulation is based on three components:
.IP "- Terminal:"
A graphical X11 application that displays the terminal window.
.IP "- Shell:"
A program that provides an interface to the operating system (e.g., /bin/sh).
.IP "- PTY:"
A pseudoterminal that creates a bi-directional channel between the Terminal and the Shell.
.P
Together, these components form a communication channel between the X11 terminal and the shell.
.SH WARNING
Be advised that iksTerm is primarily designed to work with simple shells (such as /bin/sh). More complex shells may not be fully supported and might exhibit unexpected behavior.
.SH FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
Planned enhancements include:
.IP "[x] Resizing"
Dynamic resizing of the terminal while preserving previous content.
.IP "[ ] Custom font upload (improve)"
Enhanced support for user-specified fonts.
.IP "[ ] Process control sequences & signals"
Improved handling of additional terminal control sequences.
.IP "[ ] UTF-8 support"
Support for UTF-8 encoding (currently supports only ASCII).
.IP "[ ] History navigation with arrow keys"
Implementation of a fixed-size history and navigation via arrow keys.
.IP "[x] Handling of backspace and clear command control sequences"
Proper processing of control characters such as backspace and clear (ESC [ H, ESC [ 2 J, ESC [ 3 J).
